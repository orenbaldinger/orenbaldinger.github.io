## Employment

I currently am employed by Conversica, Inc., as a software development engineer.

I have designed, developed, and maintained over many years complete web applications and developed fluency in PHP, MySQL, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, SaaS, and Authorize.net. I have maintained and expanded on existing software projects written in Python, C#, VB.NET, and PHP. I have written and consumed APIs, and built OCR and document processing applications. I am also familiar with CentOS, Ubuntu, DNS, Surgemail, NGINX, and Apache, and very experienced in refactoring, and writing maintainable, testable code. I am comfortable with Typescript, APIs, TSQL, UML, OAUTH, Selenium, Unit Testing, and Agile development strategies.
